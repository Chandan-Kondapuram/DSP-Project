Secure Database System with Query Integrity and Data Confidentiality

Project Description

This project implements a secure database system that ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and access control for multiple user groups. It is designed to:
	â€¢	Authenticate users using hashed passwords.
	â€¢	Protect sensitive data (gender and age) with encryption.
	â€¢	Detect tampered or incomplete query results using integrity checks.
	â€¢	Restrict access based on user roles.

Features

1. User Authentication

	â€¢	Secure user registration and login using bcrypt for password hashing.
	â€¢	Ensures that plaintext passwords are never stored in the database.

2. Role-Based Access Control

	â€¢	Group H: Full access to all database fields and permission to add data.
	â€¢	Group R: Restricted access (cannot view first_name and last_name) and no permission to add data.

3. Query Integrity

	â€¢	Each data record includes a row_hash for tamper detection.
	â€¢	Query results include an overall_hash to ensure completeness.

4. Data Confidentiality

	â€¢	Sensitive fields (gender and age) are encrypted using Fernet.
	â€¢	Prevents exposure of sensitive information even if the database is compromised.

Technologies Used

	â€¢	Backend: Flask
	â€¢	Database: MySQL
	â€¢	Libraries:
	â€¢	bcrypt: Password hashing.
	â€¢	Fernet: Encryption for sensitive fields.
	â€¢	mysql-connector: Database connection.
	â€¢	Language: Python

API Endpoints

1. User Registration

	â€¢	Endpoint: /register
	â€¢	Method: POST
	â€¢	Request Body:

{
  "username": "Ronaldo",
  "password": "CR7",
  "group": "H"
}


	â€¢	Response:

{
  "message": "User registered successfully!"
}



2. User Login

	â€¢	Endpoint: /login
	â€¢	Method: POST
	â€¢	Request Body:

{
  "username": "Ronaldo",
  "password": "CR7"
}


	â€¢	Response:

{
  "message": "Login successful!",
  "group": "H"
}



3. Query Data

	â€¢	Endpoint: /query
	â€¢	Method: GET
	â€¢	Query Parameter:
	â€¢	group=H or group=R
	â€¢	Response:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "gender": "encrypted_value",
    "age": "encrypted_value",
    "weight": 70.5,
    "height": 180.0,
    "health_history": "No significant health issues"
  }
]



4. Add Data (Group H Only)

	â€¢	Endpoint: /add
	â€¢	Method: POST
	â€¢	Headers:
	â€¢	username: Ronaldo
	â€¢	password: CR7
	â€¢	Request Body:

{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "gender": 1,
  "age": 30,
  "weight": 75.5,
  "height": 180,
  "health_history": "No significant health issues"
}


	â€¢	Response:

{
  "message": "Data added successfully!"
}

Setup Instructions

1. Prerequisites

	â€¢	Python 3.8 or above
	â€¢	MySQL database server
	â€¢	Required Python libraries:
	â€¢	bcrypt
	â€¢	cryptography
	â€¢	mysql-connector-python

2. Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-database-project.git
cd secure-database-project


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Set up the database:
	â€¢	Run the database_setup.py script to create the database and populate it with dummy data:

python database_setup.py



3. Run the Application

Start the Flask application:

python app.py

Testing

1. Registration

	â€¢	Test successful and failed registrations.
	â€¢	Verify the users table in the database.

2. Login

	â€¢	Test successful and failed login attempts.

3. Query Data

	â€¢	Test outputs for Group H (full access) and Group R (restricted access).

4. Add Data

	â€¢	Test successful and unauthorized attempts to add data.

5. Query Integrity

	â€¢	Modify data manually in the database and test tampered query detection.

Limitations

	1.	Key Management: The encryption key is stored locally (cipher.key), making it a single point of failure.
	2.	Query Completeness: The overall_hash mechanism may not fully prevent missing record attacks.
	3.	Performance Overhead: Encryption, decryption, and hashing operations can slow down queries as data grows.
